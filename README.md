Main steps of the development:

- setting up the the board structure
- create initializers for initial board position and FEN reader
- setting up the structure and helper functions for pawns (bit board)
- create some basic printing function for debugging
- defining hashing function for position key
- define pieces helpers arrays (such as in data.c)
- create move generations functions for each type of movement (capture, quiet move, castling)
- proceed with the creation of move making functions
